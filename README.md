$TRIP is a ERC20 that powering TripVerse protocol 
The TRIP token is designed to carry out this process rebase mechanic automatically adjust its supply in response to changes in its price.

The mechanic works by monitoring the $TRIP token’s price against a target price, which is defined as the price at which the token’s supply is to remain stable. If the current price of $TRIP is above the target price, the contract will trigger a positive rebase, increasing the supply of TRIP tokens held by each address proportionally. Conversely, if the current price is below the target price, the contract will trigger a negative rebase, reducing the supply of TRIP tokens held by each address proportionally.

The actual process of rebasing involves a calculation of the percentage difference between the current price and the target price, which is then used to adjust the total supply of TRIP tokens in circulation. This adjustment is carried out by calculating a new supply value based on the existing supply and the percentage difference, and then minting or burning tokens accordingly to bring the total supply in line with the new value.

This contract implement of a function called rebase which is used to adjust the total supply of a token based on a target price and the current price from an external price feed. The purpose of this function is to maintain the price stability of the token by adjusting the supply in response to changes in the market.

The function starts by getting the current total supply of the token and comparing it to the last supply. If they are equal, then no rebase is necessary, so the function returns. If the current supply is not equal to the last supply, the function calculates a scaling factor based on the target price, the maximum scaling factor, and the latest price from the price feed. The scaling factor is then constrained to be within a range of acceptable values.

After calculating the scaling factor, the function uses it to calculate a new rebased supply and the amount of tokens to mint. The new tokens are then minted to the sender of the transaction, and the total supply last value is updated to the new rebased supply.

The gradualRebase function is a public function that can only be called by trusted parties. It starts by getting the current total supply of the token and setting the scaling factor to an initial value of 1e18. It then calculates the price change factor based on the current price and the target price.

If the price has changed, the function calculates a gradual factor to adjust the scaling factor over time based on the percentage change in price and the rebase duration of 30 days. It then calculates the total scaling factor based on the time elapsed since the last rebase and the gradual factor.

If the total scaling factor is within an acceptable range, the scaling factor is updated with the total scaling factor, and a new rebased supply is calculated using the updated scaling factor.

Finally, the _rebase function is called to update the token state with the new rebased supply, and the last rebase timestamp is updated.

The _updateRebase function is a private function that is called by the gradualRebase function to calculate the scaling factor needed to rebase the token. It starts by getting the current price of the token pool and calculating the scaling factor based on the current pool price.

It then calculates the target supply based on the scaling factor and the total supply of the token. If the difference between the target supply and the current total supply is greater than zero, a rebaseAmount variable is initialized. However, this variable is not used in the function.
